# Kraken UI + SDR Clean Repo

This is my **private, minimal version** of the KrakenSDR-DOA repo.  
It contains only the folders that I work on directly:

- `_sdr/`
- `_ui/`

---

## üî• Purpose

This repo is used to:

- Develop and test changes in `_sdr/` and `_ui/` independently
- Push code to GitHub
- Pull into a full KrakenSDR install (ADB or other systems)
- Replace only the updated code (not the full repo)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How I Use This

1. Clone this repo
2. Work on `_sdr/` or `_ui/`
3. Push changes here
4. On the target system (with full KrakenSDR-DOA repo):
   - Copy updated `_sdr/` and `_ui/` folders into the full repo
   - Do **not** overwrite other system files
